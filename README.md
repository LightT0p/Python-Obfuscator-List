1. Oxyry obfuscator:
  | Link: https://pyob.oxyry.com/
  | SRC: None
  |_ Description: Oxyry obfuscator is a barebone obfuscator, all it really do is making you code compact ( remove moving comments, white spaces and new lines ) and just rename the variables.
  |_ The code is still very readable, just rename all the var to like "var1", "var2" etc, so the code is less confusing, no string encryption WHATSOEVER. Don't recommend
  | De-Obfuscator: Do you really need one ?
  | Notation:  游댮
